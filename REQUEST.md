### We want you to implement a simple HTTP API for interactive chat. The API includes 4 endpoints:
* [- Register a new user in the system. Having nickname provided, the endpoint shall return a unique user identifier]
* [- List all unread messages sent to a specific user. The endpoint accepts a unique user identifier and returns a list of messages targeting this user. If a message is] * [marked as already seen, it should not be returned by this endpoint]
* [- Mark a message as seen. The endpoint accepts a unique user identifier and an identifier of a message]
* [- Send a message! The endpoint accepts a unique identifier of a sender and the message itself]
